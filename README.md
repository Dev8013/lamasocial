**Lamasocial**

**A Social Media Clone built with React 19, Next.js 15, Clerk, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma**

Lamasocial is a social media platform inspired by the core functionalities of popular social media apps. It provides users with a platform to connect, share content, and interact with each other.

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend:
    * React 19
    * Next.js 15
    * Clerk (Authentication)
    * Tailwind CSS (Styling)
* Backend:
    * Prisma (ORM)
    * Database (Your preferred database - not included in this repository)

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lamasocial.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd lamasocial
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file at the project root and add the following environment variables, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=YOUR_CLERK_FRONTEND_API
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTPEND_SECRET=YOUR_CLERK_FRONTPEND_SECRET
   PRISMA_ENDPOINT=YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT
   ```

   * Obtain your Clerk API keys from the Clerk dashboard ([https://dashboard.clerk.com/](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)).
   * Set `PRISMA_ENDPOINT` to the URL of your Prisma server (instructions on setting up Prisma will be provided later).

4. **Set up database:**

   - Choose a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and install it.
   - Follow Prisma's documentation ([https://www.prisma.io/docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs)) to set up the database schema and configure the Prisma server. This typically involves creating a `schema.prisma` file and running Prisma commands to generate and migrate your database schema.

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Usage:**

Lamasocial provides features commonly found in social media platforms, such as user registration and login, creating and viewing posts, commenting, and potentially following other users (depending on your implementation). Explore the codebase and customize it to fit your specific vision for the app.

**Server-Side Actions (Next.js 15):**

Next.js 15 introduces Server-side Actions (SSAs), which allow you to perform data fetching and other server-side operations on the server before the page is rendered. This can be useful for protecting data or fetching information that requires authentication.

**Customization:**

* **Tailwind CSS:** Customize the look and feel of Lamasocial by modifying Tailwind's configuration files (`tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`).
* **Features:** Add new features and functionalities based on your requirements.
* **Data Model:** Extend or modify the Prisma data model (`schema.prisma`) to accommodate your specific data needs.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to Lamasocial! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Please ensure your contributions adhere to the project's coding style and best practices.

**License:**

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic foundation for a social media clone. Additional work will be required to implement all the features and security measures typically found in production-ready social media platforms.

**Additional Notes:**

* Consider adding unit and integration tests for your React components and Prisma queries.
* Implement robust security measures, especially for user authentication and data access control.
* Explore advanced features like image/video uploads, private messaging, and notifications.

**Getting Started with Prisma:**

To set up Prisma for your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the Prisma CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g prisma
   ```

2. Initialize a new Prisma project in the `lamasocial` directory:

   ```bash
   prisma init lamasocial
   ```

3. Choose your preferred database adapter (e.g., `postgresql`) and follow the interactive prompts to configure Prisma.
4. Define your data model in `schema.prisma`.
5. Run `prisma generate` to generate Prisma Client code based on your data model.
